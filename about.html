        What is GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?
 
        GCP is a highly reliable and scalable cloud platform offering the best cloud computing services on the web. It allows users to store and compute data, while also helping developers, test, build, and deploy applications.
         
        Google Cloud - Top Advantages And Why You Should Use It In 2020
        GCP covers apps, cloud services, and storage for mobile, web, and backend solutions over the web. The platform is trusted by over 4 million applications, showing its relevancy and reliability.
         
        The backend facet of the platform is kept utterly easy-to-use while the system acts as the platform’s base. GCP recently picked Cornerstone Tech for assisting consumers in moving their primary workload over to Google Cloud.
         
        Numerous ventures are trusting Google with their holdings and migrating their proceedings over to GCP. (IMAGE)
         
        How is Google Cloud Implemented?
         
        You can use the Google Cloud’s API on MS Office for allowing multiple people to modify a file at once. The files can also be saved after installing a plugin where every user can edit and use the data’s cloud copy. The file then becomes the master file and Google assigns a specific URL to every file.
         
        The file can only be downloaded after you have assigned an editor to the file. Any change made on the document is visible to every user. When multiple users modify the content, Google lets the creator or owner choose the modifications to remove or keep.
         
        After being synced to the master document, GCP updates every downloaded document with the metadata for maintaining the correct records.
         
        Top Benefits of Google Cloud
         
        Here are the top benefits of Google Cloud:
         
        High Productivity with Innovation
         
        As Google weekly updates the platform, your productivity level steadily increases.
         
        Easy to Adopt Latest Functionalities
         
        The changes made on the platform are small and gradual, allowing the users time to adjust.
         
        Remote Access
         
        You get complete access for accessing the data from anywhere at any time via Google’s web apps.
         
        Smooth Collaboration
         
        Google Cloud smoothens the collaboration aspect of a project by allowing simultaneous contribution and access.
         
        Unmatched Security
         
        Google is a name associated with security and its cloud counterpart is an apt example for the same.
         
        Reduced Breaches
         
        As the platform allows minimal storage of offline data, the chances of breach significantly drop.
         
        High Reliability
         
        In case an error is disrupting the data center from functioning, then the system goes to a secondary center with no interruption faced by the users.
         
        Offers Flexibility and Control
         
        You can choose the tech and have control over the data in Google applications. In case you opt-out of their services, your data can be easily extracted.
         
        Categories of Google Cloud
         
        You can divide the Google Cloud services into four major categories:
        Compute
        Storage
        Big Data
        Services
        Here is what each one stands for.
         
        Compute
         
        You can sub-divide compute into two categories,
         
        Compute Engine
         
        You can call compute engine Google’s IaaS as it runs huge workloads over virtual machines. The machine can be of your choice and preference and the bill will be prepared only for use-per-minute.
         
        Benefits 
        Compliance and Security
        Fast and Easy Provisioning
        Balanced Load
        Efficient Virtual Systems
        App Engine
         
        Unlike Compute Engine, it’s a PaaS to ensure productivity through the in-built services for developing the applications. The SDK needs to be downloaded for starting the development for free.
         
        Benefits 
        Robust Built-In Services
        Reliable Languages and Frameworks
        Renowned Tools for Development
        Focus on Code
        Storage
         
        Storage can be sub-categorized into three sections.
         
        Cloud SQL
         
        It’s a MySQL database relational helping in storing and managing data. Google facilitates its patch handling, replication, and database facilitation.
         
        Cloud Storage
         
        The service can be used for object storage and is highly durable. It facilitates remote access alongside simple API, robust services, and data handling.
         
        Cloud Datastore
         
        It acts as a schemaless database with NoSQL, handled, for the storage of any data which is non-relational.
         
        Big Data
         
        The category includes:
         
        BigQuery
         
        It assesses big data within cloud and also processes different datasets comprising multiple TBs per second while quickly running SQL like queries.
         
        Services
         
        The category includes:
         
        Cloud Endpoints
         
        Android, iOS, and JavaScript clients are able to access the code via RESTful services on their system containing the Cloud Endpoints. Its front-end wiring is seamless while the client library can be automated.
         
        The Future of Google Cloud
         
        Google Cloud appears to be focusing on capitalizing on the new web opportunities not being restricted to the current standards. It is also expected to get access to affordable internet services soon. Including fast mobile internet services worldwide alongside fiber connections within offices and homes is also a viable opportunity for them.
         
        Google Cloud - Top Advantages And Why You Should Use It In 2020
         
        Google also expects the digital world to expand rapidly with broadband making it to even the remote areas. However, the growth won’t go as far as Google expects. In order to make the vision come to fruition, Google will have to face severe competition in several markets.
         
        Wrapping Up
